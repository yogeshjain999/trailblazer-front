Some notes and guidelines for core developers.

<%= h3 "Docs" %>

* Our doc repository is [here](https://github.com/trailblazer/website).

<%= h4 "Code_tabs" %>

The `#code_tabs` helper will render two tabs `ACTIVITY` and `OPERATION`. The operation test snippet is retrieved from `test/docs/autogenerated/operation_<original file name>`. Extracting the snippet is done using `torture` mechanics both times. Sounds painful but isn't.

<%= code :ruby do %>
< %= code_tabs "create" %>
<% end %>

It's beautiful!

<%= h3 "Convert operation test" %>

Always write doc tests against `Activity::Railway` and friends. Use the conversion tool in `trailblazer-core-utils` to autogenerate an operation test.

<%= code :ruby do %>
Trailblazer::Core.convert_operation_test("test/docs/composable_variable_mapping_test.rb")
<% end %>

<%= h4 "ctx to result" %>
<%= h4 "ignore" %>
<%= h4 "skip" %>

<%= h3 "Hash inspect" %>

From Ruby 3.4 onwards, `Hash#inspect` looks different and breaks our tests. Since we use a lot of string assertions for safety reasons, please use `Trailblazer::Core::Utils.inspect` to render the asserted object.

<%= code :ruby do %>
assert_equal CU.inspect(result[:params]), %({:x=>1})
<% end %>

The `Utils.inspect` will make sure the rendered string contains "old style" hash syntax.
